# You may have different projects with different packages in your systems.
# Your one project may require pandas version 2.1 while project may require pandas version 2.2
# If you want to do both the projects in your global system then problem may arise.
# To do one project you need to install one package and for other project the other package.
# Now to solve this problem we can use virtual environment

Commands for the Virtual Environment
1. Pythpn -m venv venv
    =>It creates a new virtual environment with name "venv"
2. Venv\scripts\activate (for windows device enter this command on command prompt)
    Source venv\bin\activate (for mac and linux devised enter this command on terminal)
    => It activates the virtual environment
3. deactivate
    => It deactivates tje environment
# If we install a package with virtual environment activated, then the package is accessible for that 
# environment only. It is not installed globally. Virtual environment is only for the pip packages.

4. pip freeze 
    => It lists all the installed packages in the environment
